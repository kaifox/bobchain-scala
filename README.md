# bobchain-scala

This is ongoing work - just for exercising. The main attempt of this project is to teach myself scala and blockchain at the same time ;-)

As a start, this project is closely leant on a tutorial found at the link below, but re-implemented in scala:
https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46

Any contributions/forks/comments greatly appreciated ;-)

## Some assumptions

... However, an exercise is nice, but what about a story (particulartly useful if we want to find some names ;-) ...
Therefore, here a proposal for a (fictional) use case (for further work after the tutorial ;-) ... lets assume:

* We are creating a blockchain for clean coders: We will use it in the (far) future to reward clean coders, who are working on our code (e.g. giving valuable comments or improving it) - how to measure this might stay fictional forever ;-)
* our value token might be called 'bob' - in honor of uncle bob (http://blog.cleancoder.com/) - That is also the reason why the blockchain is called 'bobchain' for the moment

... please also here: Feel free to contribute also ideas ... this is just a start ... can change totally  (I just did not want to call the project blockchain-try-123 ;-)

## Ideas for contributing
Any contributions welcome ;-)
If you are not inerested in scala ... why not creating another client in your personal favourite language? (python, haskell, java ...)... The fun starts only if we have some nodes ;-)

The basic idea for a first version is the following:
* Communication over REST - as in the tutorial (exact API to be defined)....
